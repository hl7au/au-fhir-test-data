# HL7 AU FHIR Test Data
HL7 AU FHIR Test Data contains sample FHIR instances for testing purposes, and to support developers. This repository includes synthetic (realistic but not real) data that conforms to HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides (IGs). The synthetic data covers a broader and expanded content scope over that in the FHIR instance examples included in published HL7 AU FHIR IGs.

## Synthetic Data Properties

- **Conformance**: The synthetic data generated aims to conform to the structures and constraints defined in the corresponding HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides, as indicated. Some data may be intentionally non-conformant to support negaitve testing scenarios.

- **Anonymity and Realism**: All data is synthetic, containing no personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI). It is generated to approximate real-world properties and relationships found in actual healthcare data to support testing and development. The dataset includes Patients, Practitioners, PractitionerRoles, Organizations, Healthcare Services, and clinical resources such as *AllergyIntolerance*. Any resemblance to real entities is purely coincidental. Specifically,
  - Names are randomly generated.
  - Addresses are valid addresses based on publicly available address data from Australia Post.
  - Australian phone numbers are from the reserved set provided by the Australian Communications and Media Authority for use in creative works. 
  - Email addresses use the following domains set aside for development and testing: 'example', 'myownpersonaldomain domain', and 'my-own-personal-domain domain'. 
  - Resources with an IHI, HPI-I, or HPI-O have been provided by Services Australia and are present in the HI Vendor Test Environment. These resources may be in tests within that environment.
  - IHIs, HPI-Os, HPI-Is are provided by Services Australia for test purposes and will pass Luhn check. 
  - Medicare Card Numbers and DVA numbers are provided by Services Australia for test purposes.
  - Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) Registration Numbers are provided by Services Australia for test purposes.
  - ABNs present in the data for fictious organisations are not valid ABNs, i.e. they will not pass validity checks.

- **Unbiased**: The dataset is intended to avoid biases in data representation.

- **Variation**: The dataset aims to exhibit sufficient variation to effectively test different aspects of HL7 AU FHIR IGs, helping to validate a range of expected behaviours and constraints.

- **Data Integrity**: Relationships between different entities are maintained as accurately as possible. For example, *PractitionerRoles* are appropriately linked to *Practitioners* and *Organizations*, reflecting real-world associations.

## How to navigate this repository
Synthetic FHIR test data (JSON) files are available in the following directories: 
* [generated](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/generated) – contains test data generated from other source formats (e.g., XLS/CSV, QuestionnaireResponse) using tooling that includes mappings and utilities for conversion and validation,
* [direct-fhir-test-resources](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/direct-fhir-test-resources) - includes test data for verifying missing data and suppressed data test cases (for details see [MissingAndSuppressedData_TestData.md](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/blob/master/docs/MissingAndSuppressedData_TestData.md)),
* [erequesting](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/erequesting) _(stub - to be expanded)_,

Documentation on Confluence for the HL7 FHIR Test Data project details the [development process](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/HAFWG/pages/265093726/Process+Test+Data+-+iterative+development). It outlines the role of CSV-to-FHIR mappings located in the [Sparked.Csv2FhirMapping/Maps](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/Sparked.Csv2FhirMapping/Maps) directory, and GitHub workflows found in the [.github](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/.github) directory, some of which depend on utilities from the [hl7au/au-fhir-test-data-utils repository](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data-utils). These workflows are part of a CI pipeline that validates FHIR data, supporting contributors and reviewers in identifying and resolving validation errors before merging changes, and can automate the upload of test data to a target server.
The documentation also explains the approach to managing quarantined instances — test data instances that are assessed as valid but report errors that can be justified (such as tooling or terminology service issues). These instances are listed in the [quarantine](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/blob/master/quarantine) directory to avoid confounding subsequent QA/validation report reviews, with justifications provided via inline comments.

To support HL7 AU Connectathons, Postman collection import files containing a selection of AU Core and AU eRequesting Test Data, along with sample Postman environment import files, are available in the [Postman](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/Postman) directory.

## Test Data Coverage of HL7 AU FHIR Implementation Guides
The test dataset is developed on a best-effort basis, aiming to provide broad coverage of HL7 AU IG profiles and extensions. The extent of coverage evolves iteratively, shaped by the maturity of the IGs, shifting priorities of HL7 AU projects, available resources, and community contributions. For example, in the case of the AU Core IG, the dataset includes coverage of Must Support elements within AU Core profiles and extensions. The current coverage is documented in [AUCoreTestDataCoverage.md](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/blob/master/AUCoreTestDataCoverage.md).

## Versioning
The versioning approach follows **a modified Semantic Versioning (semver) strategy** aligned with HL7 AU conventions:

### **Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`**
- **MAJOR** (`X.0.0`) – Indicates a major milestone or significant changes, often aligning with a HL7 AU FHIR Test Data Project Release.
- **MINOR** (`X.Y.0`) – Used for incremental releases within a major version.
- **PATCH** (`X.Y.Z`) – Represents small fixes, technical corrections, and refinements to existing test data without introducing breaking changes.
- **Pre-release** (`X.Y.0-beta`) may be used for testing purposes before an official release.

Tags are used to mark releases, and repository states such as for HL7 AU Connectathons and Sparked Test Events, supporting consistency across testing environments and the reproducibility of test results.
