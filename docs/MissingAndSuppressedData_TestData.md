## Significant Missing Data and Suppressed Data Test Cases
The following test data files within the [direct-fhir-test-resources](https://github.com/hl7au/au-fhir-test-data/tree/master/direct-fhir-test-resources) directory support testing of significant test cases including missing data and suppressed data.

File Name | Resource Id | Test Case | Expected Outcome 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Patient-italia-sofia-suppressed-birthDate.json | italia-sofia-suppressed-birthDate | Patient with a suppressed birthDate | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension within a primitate data type extension and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error. 
Patient-italia-sofia-suppressed-gender.json | italia-sofia-suppressed-gender | Patient with a suppressed gender | A Responder SHALL correctly populate using value of 'unknown' and a Requester SHALL accept the 'unknown' value without error.
Patient-italia-sofia-suppressed-identifier.json | italia-sofia-suppressed-identifier | Patient with suppressed identifiers | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension within Identifier.extension and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error. **Currently validation using the Sparked Reference FHIR Server rejects this instance due to rule au-core-pat-01.**
Patient-italia-sofia-suppressed-name.json | italia-sofia-suppressed-name | Patient with suppressed names | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension within HumanName.extension and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error. **Currently validation using the Sparked Reference FHIR Server rejects this instance due to rules au-core-pat-02 and au-core-pat-04.**
Observation-pathresult-missing-effective.json | pathresult-missing-effective | Pathology Result Observation with missing effectiveDateTime | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension represented using a primitate data type extension, and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error. **Currently validation using the Sparked Reference FHIR Server rejects this instance due to rule Rule au-core-obs-01.**
Observation-pathresult-missing-status.json | pathresult-missing-status | Pathology Result Observation with missing status | A Responder SHALL correctly populate using value of 'unknown', and a Requester SHALL accept this value without error.
Observation-pathresult-suppressed-code.json | pathresult-suppressed-code | Pathology Result Observation with suppressed code | A Responder SHALL correctly populate the coding using a code (masked or unknown) from the Data Absent Reason value set, and a Requester SHALL accept this coding without error. 
Observation-pathresult-suppressed-dataAbsentReason.json | pathresult-suppressed-dataAbsentReason | Pathology Result Observation with suppressed value using dataAbsentReason | Using dataAbsentReason is NOT the recommended representation of a suppressed test result value in AU Core. 
Observation-pathresult-suppressed-subject.json | pathresult-suppressed-subject | Pathology Result Observation with suppressed subject | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension within Reference.extension and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error.
Observation-pathresult-suppressed-valueCodeableConcept.json | pathresult-suppressed-valueCodeableConcept | Pathology Result Observation with suppressed codeable value | A Responder SHALL correctly populate the coding with a code (masked or unknown) from the Data Absent Reason value set, and a Requester SHALL accept this coding without error. 
Observation-pathresult-suppressed-valueQuantity.json | pathresult-suppressed-valueQuantity | Pathology Result Observation with suppressed non-coded value (complex data types) | A Responder SHALL correctly populate a Data Absent Reason extension within the value[x].extension and a Requester SHALL accept this extension without error.
